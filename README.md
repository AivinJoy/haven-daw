## 🚀 Features

* **Hybrid Audio Engine:** Built in Rust using `cpal` and `symphonia` for low-latency playback.
* **Visual Waveforms:** High-performance canvas rendering with smart caching (60fps).
* **Non-Destructive Arrangement:** Drag-and-drop clips, visual snapping, and resizing.
* **Real-time Mixer:** Volume, Pan, Mute, and Solo controls with absolute seeking.
* **BPM Sync:** Automatic BPM detection and grid alignment.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Rust & Cargo:** [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
    ```
2.  **Node.js & npm (or pnpm):** [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
3.  **Tauri Dependencies:**
    * **Windows:** Install "C++ Build Tools" via Visual Studio Installer and the "WebView2" runtime.
## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haven-daw.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haven-daw.git)
    cd haven
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```



## ▶️ Running Development Server

To start the app in development mode (with hot-reloading):

```bash
cd haven 

npm run tauri dev

The Frontend will load at localhost:1420.

The Rust Backend will compile and launch the native window.


📂 Project Structure
src/ - Frontend (SvelteKit): UI components, Timeline logic, Canvas rendering.

src-tauri/ - Backend (Rust): Bridging, Window management, Command handlers.

daw_modules/ - Audio Engine: Core DSP, Decoder, Mixer, and Playback logic.

🐛 Common Issues
"No Audio Device Found": Ensure your OS default output device is active before launching.

"Waveform Mismatch": If the visual waveform looks misaligned, check that the sample rate matches the backend (default 44.1kHz or 48kHz).
